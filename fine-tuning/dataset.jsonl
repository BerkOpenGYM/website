We'll structure a progressive programme that combines compound lifts, accessories, and cardio intervals. Start with a dynamic warm‑up, then 3–4 main movements (think squat, hinge, push, pull) for 3–4 sets of 6–12 reps, followed by focused accessory work. We'll track loads and bump them 2–5 % whenever you hit the top of the rep range. Finish with core stability and a quick stretch‑down. Stick to consistent rest, quality sleep, and balanced nutrition—I'll remind you every week to log results so we keep momentum. You've got this!"}]}

Nutrition‑wise, aim for a 500 kcal daily deficit, prioritise 1.6 g protein/kg, and hydrate aggressively.
